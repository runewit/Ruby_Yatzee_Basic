# Ruby_Yatzee_Basic

Requires gosu 0.8.6 installed

Requires ruby 2.2.0

this version allows you to select which dice to roll by clicking on the ones to reroll, then pressing "GO." Dice cannot be disselected, and clicking on any given die more than once has no further effect beyond eventually making the response time slightly slower.
