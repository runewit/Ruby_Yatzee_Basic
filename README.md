# Ruby_Yatzee_Basic

Requires gosu 0.8.6 installed

Requires ruby 2.2.0

Basic_Yatzee_Graphics
this version allows you to select which dice to roll by clicking on the ones to reroll, then pressing "GO." Dice cannot be disselected, and clicking on any given die more than once has no further effect beyond eventually making the response time slightly slower.

Yatzee3
This version works perfectly.  It is purely text-based, but if given proper text response (prompted by game) one can play through the entirety of a game of Yatzee.

Yatzee4
this version doesn't work.  My attempts to integrate Gosu into Yatzee3 clashed the command prompt waiting for a response against Gosu wanting to update 60 times a second, so it seems to just crash.
